To-Do List App:

Hi there! This is the upgraded version of my to-do list app. I’ve added some extra stuff to make it fun and motivating, not just a plain checklist.

New Features

Streak System → counts how many tasks you finish in a row. If you miss, it resets back to 0.
Milestone Celebrations → hit 10, 20, 30 completed tasks in a row and you get a full-screen confetti blast.
Daily Summary → shows how many tasks you added and completed today.
Duplicate Task Check → if you try to add the same task 3 times or more, it asks if you actually want to add it again (like Google search suggestions).
Deadline Sorting → tasks automatically sort by deadline so you don’t lose track.

Visuals

Confetti falls from the top of the screen, full width.
Motivational quotes pop up when you complete tasks.
Each task shows priority color (red = high, orange = medium, green = low).
