To-Do List App:

Hi there! This is my very first web development project, built during a Build-a-thon. The goal was to create a functional and simple To-Do List app while learning the basics of front-end development. I built the To-Do List App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. AI tools were used to brainstorm ideas and assist with code optimization, but all implementation and customization were done by me. This project helped me learn web development basics, project planning, and problem-solving under time constraints.


Features:

Add Tasks – Quickly add anything you need to get done.  
Mark as Complete – Check off tasks as you finish them.  
Delete Tasks – Remove tasks you no longer need.  
Responsive Design – Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.  

Start adding, checking off, and deleting tasks!

This project was a fun and educational experience that helped me kickstart my web development journey. I’m excited to continue building more projects and improving my skills! Feel free to check it out, use it, or suggest improvements!
