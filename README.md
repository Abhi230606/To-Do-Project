To-Do List App:

Hey there! This is a simple and clean To-Do List web application I built to help organize daily tasks. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no fancy frameworks needed.

Features:

Add Tasks – Quickly add anything you need to get done.  
Mark as Complete – Check off tasks as you finish them.  
Delete Tasks – Remove tasks you no longer need.  
Responsive Design – Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.  

Start adding, checking off, and deleting tasks!

This app was a fun way to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and improve my front-end skills. Feel free to check it out, use it, or suggest improvements!
